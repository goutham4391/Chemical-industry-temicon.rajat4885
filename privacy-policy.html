The data controller shall make the correction without delay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Right to erasure acc. to Art. 17 GDPR</strong></h3><p>(1) You may request the controller to delete your personal data immediately and the controller is obliged to delete such data immediately if one of the following reasons applies:</p><ol><li>The personal data concerning you are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.</li><li>You revoke your consent on which the processing was based in accordance with Article 6 (1) (a) or Article 9 (2) (a) of the GDPR and there is no other legal basis for the processing.</li><li>You object to the processing in accordance with Article 21 (1) GDPR and there are no legitimate reasons for the processing which take precedence, or you object to the processing in accordance with Article 21 (2) GDPR.</li><li>The personal data concerning you have been processed unlawfully</li><li>The deletion of personal data concerning you is necessary to comply with a legal obligation under Union law or the law of the Member States to which the controller is subject.</li><li>The personal data concerning you have been collected in relation to information society services offered, in accordance with Article 8 (1) of the GDPR.</li></ol><p>(2) If the controller has made your personal data public and is obliged to delete them in accordance with Article 17 (1) of the GDPR, he shall take reasonable measures, including technical measures, taking into account the available technology and implementation costs, to inform data controllers who process the personal data that you, as a data subject, have requested them to delete all links to these personal data or copies or replications of these personal data.</p><p>(3) The right to erasure shall not apply where the processing is necessary</p><ol><li>for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information;</li><li>to comply with a legal obligation to which the processing is subject under Union or national law to which the controller is subject, or to carry out a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official&nbsp; authority vested in the controller;</li><li>for reasons of public interest relating to public health pursuant to Art. 9, para. 2 lit. h and i as well as Art. 9 para. 3 GDPR;</li><li>for archiving purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Art. 89 para. 1 GDPR, insofar as the right referred to in para. 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously prejudice the attainment of the objectives of such processing, or</li><li>to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Right to restriction of processing acc. to Art. 18 GDPR</strong></h3><p>Under the following conditions, you may request the restriction of the processing of your personal data:</p><ol><li>if you dispute the accuracy of your personal data for a period of time that allows the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;</li><li>if the processing is unlawful and you refuse to delete the personal data and instead request the restriction of the use of the personal data;</li><li>if the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you need them for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims; or</li><li>if you have lodged an objection to the processing pursuant to Article 21 (1) of the GDPR and it is not yet clear whether the legitimate reasons of the controller outweigh your reasons.</li></ol><p>If the processing of your personal data has been restricted, these data - apart from their storage - may only be processed with your consent or for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims or protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of major public interest of the Union or a Member State. If the restriction on processing has been restricted in accordance with the above conditions, you will be informed by the controller before the restriction is lifted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing acc. to Art. 19 GDPR</strong></h3><p>If you have exercised the right to rectify, erase or limit the processing, the controller is obliged to notify all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have been disclosed of this rectification, erasure or limitation of processing, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. You have the right to be informed of these recipients by the controller.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Right to data portability acc. to Art. 20 GDPR</strong></h3><p>You have the right to receive your personal data, which you have provided to the responsible person, in a structured, common and machine-readable format. In addition, you have the right to transfer this data to another responsible party without hindrance by the responsible party to whom the personal data has been made available, if</p><ol><li>the processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 letter a) GDPR or Art. 9 Para. 2 letter a) GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 letter b) GDPR and</li><li>the processing is carried out using automated procedures. In exercising this right, you also have the right to request that your personal data be transferred directly from one responsible party to another, insofar as this is technically feasible. The freedoms and rights of other persons may not be impaired by this. The right to data transferability shall not apply to the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Right of objection acc. to Art. 21 GDPR</strong></h3><p>You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of your personal data carried out on the basis of Article 6 (1) (e) or (f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The controller will no longer process your personal data unless it can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. If your personal data is processed for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to processing of your personal data for such marketing; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is related to such direct marketing. If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, your personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes. You have the possibility, in connection with the use of information society services - notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC - to exercise your right to object by means of automated procedures using technical specifications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority acc. to Art. 77 GDPR</strong></h3><p>Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your residence, place of employment or place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR. The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged will inform the complainant of the status and outcome of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Article 77 of the GDPR.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Automated decision in individual cases including profiling</strong></h3><p>You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing operations, including profiling, which produces legal effects vis-à-vis it or significantly affects it in a similar way. This shall not apply where the decision is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between you and the controller,</p><ol><li>is authorised by Union or national legislation to which the controller is subject and that legislation lays down appropriate measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or</li><li>is made with your express consent.</li></ol><p><br /> However, such decisions may not relate to specific categories of personal data as defined in Art. However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of personal data under Art. 9 Par. 1 GDPR, unless Art. 9 Par. 2 lit. a) or g) applies and adequate measures have been taken to protect the rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests. In the cases referred to in a. and c., the controller shall take adequate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests, which shall include at least the right to obtain the intervention of a person from the controller, to express his or her point of view and to challenge the decision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Integration of other third-party services and content</strong></h3><p><strong>Description and purpose</strong></p><p>It can happen that within this online offer contents of third parties, such as videos, fonts or graphics from other websites are integrated. This always requires that the providers of these contents (hereinafter referred to as &quot;third party providers&quot;) are aware of the IP address of the users. Without the IP address, they would not be able to send the content to the browser of the respective user. The IP address is therefore necessary for the display of this content. We make every effort to use only such content whose respective providers use the IP address only to deliver the content. However, we have no influence on this if the third-party providers store the IP address for statistical purposes, for example. As far as we are aware of this, we inform the users about it. We would like to provide and improve our online offer through these integrations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>The legal basis for the integration of other services and content of third parties is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our overriding legitimate interest lies in the intention of an appropriate presentation of our online presence and user-friendly and economically efficient services on our part. For further information, please refer to the respective privacy statements of the providers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Contractual or legal obligation to provide personal data</strong></p><p>The provision of personal data is neither legally nor contractually required and is also not necessary for the conclusion of a contract. You are also not obliged to provide the personal data. However, failure to provide it may mean that you are unable to use this function or cannot use it to its full extent.</p></div></div>

Matomo is used on the basis of legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1), lit. f) GDPR. We use Matomo to obtain data protection-friendly statistics on user behaviour for the purpose of improving our website.</p><p>We store Matomo exclusively on the server of this website. Pseudonymised data about website visits are only stored on our own server. No data are transferred to third parties.</p><p>Matomo is set up in such a way that your IP address is immediately anonymised when you enter the website. Your IP address can therefore not be traced back to you. Furthermore, Matomo does not set any cookies, but uses the &quot;device fingerprinting&quot; method to identify your terminal device when you call up various sub-pages of our website. From the device characteristics, the analytics programme generates a visit ID, which is a quasi fingerprint of the website user. These visit IDs are only stored on the website server. They can be assigned to further visits with the same profile, but no longer directly to a person. The IDs are deleted after 24 hours at the latest. This prevents recurring visitors to the website from being recognised and personal user profiles from being created.</p><p>You can object to the data analysis and storage of data by Matomo at any time. Only if you actively decide against Matomo data collection and use the following opt-out function, a technically necessary cookie will be set on your system. As long as this so-called opt-out cookie is stored in your browser, Matomo will not collect any data. If you delete your cookies, the Matomo opt-out cookie will also be deleted. You must then reactivate the opt-out when you visit our website again.</p><p>To deactivate Matomo, remove the tick in the following check box.</p></div></div>

Insofar as special categories of personal data within the meaning of Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR are voluntarily communicated as part of the application procedure, they will also be processed in accordance with Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. b GDPR (e.g. health data, such as severely disabled status or ethnic origin).</p><p>Insofar as special categories of personal data within the meaning of Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR are requested from applicants within the framework of the application procedure, their processing is additionally carried out in accordance with Art. 9 Para. 2 letter a GDPR (e.g. health data if these are necessary for the exercise of the profession). If made available, applicants can submit their applications to us by means of an online form on our website. The data will be transmitted to us in encrypted form according to the state of the art. Applicants can also send us their applications by e-mail. Please note, however, that e-mails are generally not encrypted and that applicants must ensure that they are encrypted themselves.</p><p>We can therefore not assume any responsibility for the transmission path of the application between the sender and the receipt on our server and therefore recommend rather to use an online form or the postal dispatch. This is because instead of applying via the online form and e-mail, applicants still have the option of sending us their application by post. In the event of a successful application, the data provided by the applicants can be processed by us for the purposes of the employment relationship. Otherwise, if the application for a job offer is not successful, the applicants' data is deleted. Applicants' data is also deleted if an application is withdrawn, which applicants are entitled to do at any time. Subject to a justified revocation by the applicants, the data will be deleted after the expiry of a period of six months so that we can answer any follow-up questions regarding the application and meet our obligations to provide evidence under the Equal Treatment Act. Invoices for any reimbursement of travel expenses will be archived in accordance with tax law requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Safety</strong></h3><p>We have taken extensive <a href="https://keyed.de/blog/tom-dsgvo/" target="_blank"class="tlink link--external" target="_blank">technical and operational precautions</a> to protect your data from accidental or deliberate manipulation, loss, destruction or access by unauthorised persons.
